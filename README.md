quickly: to be reorganized !

This folder contains react-typescript projects.
In the src/ for in each project root folder, you can find different solution for the same project:

- functional
- class
- context hooks
- context class
- useReducer hook
- redux base
- etc ...

For each project all the solutions are run at the same time.
See index.tsx to understand more about each solution being rendered

For technical infos take a look in the package.json

For each project I should post some VIEW_ME screen shoots or some GIF
to let you preview what is the output for the project.

All those projects exists in other formats:

- react.js only at 
- Vue.js ( options API and composition API) at 
- vue + typeScript( composition API oly) at 


It could be very instructive to find out solution for those same project
using NextJS, GatsbyJS, Deno, Svelte, etc... and why not other non javascript
based technologies like Java, Python, etc...

Remember: diversification of knowledge in Web development helps grasps in deep but 
consumes time.
